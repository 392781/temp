Prof. Gu receives a new NSF grant on "Collaborative Research: Elements: Scalable and Automated Learning of Active Dynamics (SALAD)". Here is a description of the project: Active dynamics describes systems with emerging, out-of-equilibrium processes, driven by self-propelled agents consuming energy from an internal reservoir or from their surroundings. Examples of active dynamics include flocks of birds, schools of fish, layers of cells, and networks of filamentous proteins. Probabilistic models and statistical analysis are indispensable for understanding active dynamics due to intrinsic fluctuations of the agents and noises from the experiments. This project supports software development to simulate active dynamics, and to infer the laws that govern it from analyzing state-of-the-art experimental data, such as high-resolution microscopy videos. The development reduces the time-consuming reimplementation of simulation and estimation approaches, and promotes cross-disciplinary collaborations for applications in data science, tissue engineering and biomanufacturing.Congratulations, Prof. Gu!
