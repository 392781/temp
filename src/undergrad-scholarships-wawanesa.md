### Wawanesa Scholarship in Actuarial and Financial Mathematics and Statistics

Wawanesa Insurance and the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability at UC Santa Barbara are proud to announce the establishment of the **Wawanesa Scholarship in Actuarial and Financial Mathematics and Statistics** (FMS) for academic years 2016-2019.

 

The Wawanesa gift will help UC Santa Barbara attract and retain stellar undergraduate students interested in majoring in Actuarial Science and Financial Mathematics and Statistics. Furthermore, the Wawanesa Scholarship will support a select number of undergraduate students heading into their junior or senior year of study who are declared Actuarial Science or Financial Mathematics and Statistics majors or pre-majors, have GPA of 3.25 or better, and are in their third or fourth year of study.

 

The award amount will be based on the individual recipients' unique financial and academic circumstances and could range from $2,500 to $3,500 per student annually. A preference will be given to students from underrepresented and first-generation backgrounds.

 

Wawanesa is a proud company with a long history dating back to 1896. The company takes pride in its stability, both financial and operational, and plans to continue growing in the future just as it has in the past. Wawanesa wishes to provide ever increasing numbers of policyholders with excellent products and service. Its mutual ownership structure both allows and requires the company to take a steady and prudent approach to balancing growth and financial strength.
