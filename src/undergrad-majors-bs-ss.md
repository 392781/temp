# BS in Statistics and Data Science

## Overview

The Department typically advises students to choose the B.S. in Statistics and Data Science degree over the B.A. in Statistics and Data Science degree because it provides better preparation for the work force.

### B.S. degree vs. B.A. degree

The Bachelor of Science degree differs from the Bachelor of Art program in two ways:

1. by requiring **12 more upper-division units** (3 courses)
2. by requiring **PSTAT 122** (an optional elective for those pursuing the B.A.)

## Recommended preparation for the major

High School students are recommended the following in preparation for the major:

- two years of algebra
- courses in plane geometry and trigonometry
