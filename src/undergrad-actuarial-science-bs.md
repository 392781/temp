# BS in Actuarial Science

## Overview

In the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, we offer B.S. in Actuarial Science which will prepare you for a career in the actuarial profession. Multiple actuarial designations are available nowadays, including Fellow of the Society of Actuaries, Fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society, Certified Enterprise Risk Analyst and Registered Professional Liability Underwriter. Our degree will help you pass the actuarial exams which are necessary to obtain these certifications and future career advancement. You can also join the [Actuarial Association](http://actuaryclub.pstat.ucsb.edu/) to meet other students who share your interests and aspirations.

All actuarial science majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. Their advice is crucial in designing a coherent undergraduate program.

In the course sequence PSTAT 296AB, Research for Actuaries, students will complete research projects in the area of actuarial science. Each project will be supervised by at least one ladder faculty member and approved by a project committee that includes at least two members of the department's ladder faculty.
