## Data Science Consulting Laboratory

The Data Science Consulting Laboratory - DataLab - provides advice on statistical and machine learning methods to researchers (faculty and graduate students) at UCSB. Advice can be given at all stages of an investigation — planning the data collection, choosing the appropriate statistical methods for valid interpretation of results, choosing effective software for calculation and graphical display and figuring out how to do the numerical work on a computer and reporting the final statistical results. Please go to [https://datascience.ucsb.edu/consulting](https://datascience.ucsb.edu/consulting) to request a consultation.
