### [Certificate in College and University Teaching](https://ext-prod.graddiv.ucsb.edu/policy-procedure/certificate-in-teaching) (CCUT)

"The UCSB Certificate in College and University Teaching (CCUT) is designed for students who wish to demonstrate superior competence and experience in preparation for teaching at the university or college level. Certificate requirements include completion or attainment of a number of teaching-related skills and experiences culminating in independent instruction of an entire course with the support of a UCSB faculty mentor. Students interested in getting the certificate thus need to obtain a position as an independent instructor either as a Teaching Associate in the regular or summer session on campus or at an off-campus junior college, college, or university location. Certificates are awarded in conjunction with a Ph.D. or MFA degree upon recommendation by the CCUT Faculty Advisory Board to the Graduate Dean."
