![](/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.stat.d7/files/sitefiles/Photos/UC_Santa_Barbara-124.jpg)Statistics is the study of numerical information or data. Statisticians determine what data to collect, how to collect it, and then examine and interpret the resulting numbers. Their skills are vital in Business, Economics, Finance, Communications, Biology, Marketing, Sociology, Psychology, etc. The demand for statisticians has been high in the past and only continues to rise.

The Actuarial Science and Financial Mathematics and Statistics degrees, as well as an active [Actuarial Association](http://actuaryclub.pstat.ucsb.edu/), are what make our program so unique.
