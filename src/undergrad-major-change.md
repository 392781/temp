Major sheets specifying course requirements and example plans can be found under the major's page [here](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/undergrad/majors). ​

*Pre-PSTAT major applicants**:* PSTAT 120A clearance will be given to students who are on track to complete the pre-major by the end of Winter 2025. If you have more than 3 pre-major/preparation courses to complete, focus on completing those first. *Full ACTSCI major applicants**:* WRIT 107B can be taken before or after declaring the full major.
