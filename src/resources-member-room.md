## How to request a Department Room Reservation

The Ad Astra system UCSB uses for general assignment classroom spaces and computer labs can be found [here](https://www.aaiscloud.com/UCA_SantaBarbara/).

The Ad Astra system will require you to log in using your netid and password. Once logged in, you can view current room bookings under "Calendar" &gt; "Scheduling Grids" on the top left of the page. It will automatically show you the bookings for the current day, but you can change it to week view at the top left. If you would like to see the room bookings for computer labs, you can filter the room type to "Collaborate" on the top right of the page. 

If you would like to book a one-time room request, you can submit a request [here](https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/faculty-staff/resources-for-faculty-staff/scheduling-resources/room-request). Please note that room requests will need to be submitted at least one week in advance. Most requests you submit will be an "Academic Department One-Time Room Request". If you would like assistance booking a room, please contact the Undergraduate Advisor. 

If your request is approved, you will receive the booking confirmation via email. 

Please note that **only faculty and instructors may book rooms using the request form above**.
