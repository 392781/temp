**Abstract:** 

Cardiometabolic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic lung conditions, remain significant public health challenges globally. In this presentation, I will explore the intricate relationships between socioeconomic status (SES), lifestyle factors, and cardiometabolic disease (CMD) outcomes using data from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS). Leveraging structural equation modeling (SEM), I will examine the potential mediating effects of lifestyle choices, such as physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption, on the relationship between SES and CMD, offering fresh insights into persistent health disparities in the United States.  
Additionally, I will discuss the broader implications of these findings for designing holistic public  
health interventions and policies. By addressing cardiometabolic health disparities at individual,  
community, and national levels, this study underscores the necessity of integrating behavioral,  
structural, and systemic approaches to promote health equity and improve outcomes across diverse populations.

 

**Short bio:** 

Dr. Ebenezer Larnyo is a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Center for Black Studies Research (CBSR) at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is also the facilitator and mentor of the CBSR’s Student Engagement and Enrichment in Data Science (SEEDS) program. He holds a Ph.D. in Management Science and Engineering from Jiangsu University and an MSc in Computer Science and Technology from Jiangsu University of Science and Technology in Zhenjiang, China. Before joining UC Santa Barbara, he was an Assistant Research Professor-Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Health Policy and Management at Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China. 

 

Ebenezer’s research examines the impact of various factors, including social, economic, structural, and techno-cultural determinants on the quality of life of older adults. He is also interested in how healthcare technologies and data science can be leveraged to enhance the quality of life, improve access to personalized healthcare, and reduce the burden of chronic and aging-related diseases among older adults and people with cognitive impairment, particularly those in minority communities in the US and Sub-Saharan Africa. Ebenezer is very passionate about using research to improve the lives of older adults and reduce health disparities. He is committed to working with communities to develop and implement solutions that are culturally appropriate and responsive to the needs of older adults.
