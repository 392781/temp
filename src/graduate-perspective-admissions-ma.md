Admission decisions are made by the departmental Graduate Admissions Committee. Admission to the program is based on academic achievement, programmatic fit, and scholarly potential. 

Our graduate programs are open to those who hold a bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Mathematics, or other fields with strong quantitative requirements. The department is expecting that quantitive courses, particularly those regarding statistical theory, be passed with distinction.

## General Requirements

### Education

All applicants must hold a bachelor's degree in Statistics, Mathematics, or other strong quantitative fields

### Coursework

- Calculus-based Probability, law of large numbers and central limit theorems.
- Theory of statistical inference, hypothesis tests and regressions.
- Linear algebra including vector spaces, bases in vector spaces, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.

### GPA

The minumum undergraduate GPA requirement for admission is an overall 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. Meeting the requirement does not guarantee admission; the actual standard for admission is set by the current pool of applicants and is generally much higher.

### Exams

We will NOT require a GRE for applicants applying to the MA or PhD program in the Fall of 2024 (i.e. applying to be part of the entering class of Fall 2025).
