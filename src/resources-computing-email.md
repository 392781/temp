# Email

## Checking e-mail, making calendar appointments or subscribing to lists via web:

The University uses a [Connect/Google service](https://www.connect.ucsb.edu/messaging-collaboration-services/google-workspace) for email, calendaring and groups (lists) for department communications and planning; you can check your mail at [https://mail.google.com/a/ucsb.edu](https://mail.google.com/a/ucsb.edu "Outgoing link (in new window)").

Remember to use your **UCSBNetID credentials** when logging into your "Google Workspace" account.

For more information about configuring webmail; including forward, vacation, and spam settings, visit [**this page.**](https://support.google.com/mail?hl=en&authuser=0#topic=7065107 "Email / Webmail")

## Password Change/Reset:

[**Click here**](https://www.identity.ucsb.edu/ucsbnetid/password "Outgoing link (in new window)")

Selecting a secure password helps protect your privacy and security. At minimum it is required a password length between 12 and 16 characters, and a mix of upper case letters, lower case letters, special characters, and digits.  

 

Here are a few recommendations:

- Include similar looking characters, such as the number zero for the letter 'O' or '$' for the letter 'S'
- Include phonetic replacements, such as 'Luv2Laf' for 'LovetoLaugh'
- Don't use a password that contains personal information (name, birth date, etc.)
- Don't use words or acronyms that can be found in a dictionary
- Don't use keyboard patterns (asdf) or sequential numbers (1234)
- Don't use repeating characters (aa11)
- Never tell your password to anyone (this includes significant others, roommates, parrots, etc.)
- Never write your password down
- Never send your password by email
- Periodically test your current password and change it to a new one
