# Student Clubs

PSTAT works closely with the following student clubs on campus: The Actuarial Association, Female Actuarial Organization,  and the Data Science Club.

## [Actuarial Association](http://actuaryclub.pstat.ucsb.edu/prospective-students/membership/)

*The UCSB Actuary Club is a great way to meet motivated people in your the same major and study together for classes and exams. We also provide material for the first 4 exams so students do not have to buy manuals and spend too much money. We also host career workshops when we invite big companies to present and interview our members. It’s a fantastic community in which students help and support each other.*

## [Data Science Club](http://datascience.pstat.ucsb.edu/)

*Data Science at UCSB is a university club founded and organized by students for students. Working closely with UCSB’s Statistics and Applied Probability Department, we aim to get Gauchos on the path to a successful career in data science and analytics through group projects, peer education, and presentations from industry leaders. Our members learn the tools of the trade, such as Python, R and SQL, while bolstering soft skills like public speaking, teamwork, and delegation.*
